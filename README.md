# z80mbc2-examples
Example Z80 code and programs for the z80-mbc2 SBC

This is a collection of z80 assembler code files to use on the z80mbc2 single board computer

Currently they are compiled using the z80asm program from SLR Systems. This can be found in many cp/m repos with a quick search of the web.

Asuming you have copied the z80asm.com file and the *.z80 program you want to test onto the z80mbc2 drive f: you would compile the programs with:

f:

z80asm led

(this would be for the file led.z80, and flashes the user led)

There are pre-compiled versions in the "com" folder.
